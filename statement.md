# Project Statement – Library Management System

## 1. Problem Statement
Libraries need a simple system to store book information, search books, issue and return books.  
This project aims to build a lightweight, menu-driven Library Management System using Python.

## 2. Functional Requirements
- Add a book  
- View all books  
- Search for books  
- Issue a book  
- Return a book  
- Exit the system  

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements
- Easy to use  
- Fast response time  
- No external dependencies  
- Works on all OS  

## 4. System Architecture
User → Application Menu → Operations (Add, Search, Issue, Return)

## 5. UML Diagrams
### Use Case Diagram
(Describe: User → Add/Search/Issue/Return)

### Workflow Diagram
(Linear flow: Input → Operation → Output)

### Sequence Diagram
User → System → Result

### Class / Component Diagram
- Library
- Book
- User actions

(You can add diagrams as images later)

## 6. Design Decisions
- Used Python for simplicity  
- Used lists to store books  
- Used dictionaries to represent each book  

## 7. Implementation Details
Implementation done using functions and lists. No database used.

## 8. Screenshots / Results
(Add after running code)

## 9. Testing Approach
Tested all menu options with various inputs.

## 10. Challenges Faced
- Removing issued books correctly  
- Maintaining clean menu interface  

## 11. Learnings & Key Takeaways
- Data structures in Python  
- How to organize code into functions  
- How to use GitHub  

## 12. Future Enhancements
- Add database (SQLite)  
- Add login for librarian  
- Add GUI (Tkinter)

## 13. References
- Python Documentation  
- GitHub Guides
